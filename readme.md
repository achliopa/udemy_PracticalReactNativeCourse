# Udemy Course: React Native - The Practical Guide

* [Course Repo]()


## Section 1 - Getting Started

### Lecture 2 - What is React Native

* Ionic, Swift: Write once, run everywhere
* React Native: Learn once, write everywhere => Build real mobile apps using JS and React(Native)
* React Native Apps are NOT web apps running on Mobile
* React native Apps are NOT hybrid apps (WebApp hosted by webview) like Ionic or Cordoba
* React native Apps and JS code are compiled to Native Code
* We use React+ReactNative code and components that compile to native code

### Lecture 3 - A Closer Look

* ReactNative uses React syntax to implkement native feats using similar concepts like:
	* Web React: <div> => Native Component (Android): android.view => Native Component (iOS): UIView => React Native: <View>
	* Web React: <inout> => Native Component (Android): EditText => Native Component (iOS): UITextField => React Native: <TextInput>
* IN react Native we dont use DOM jsx components but Mobile Native Components wrapped as JSX components

### Lecture 4 - What Happens to Javascript?

* in React native our JS logic is not compiled to native code. it stays in a JS Thread hosted by the React native App nile node.js
* UI is compiled to native

### Lecture 5 - Creating Our First React Native App

* We need Node JS. we need it to install packages and a RN dev server (update code as it run on simulator or device)
* we need Node v8.9 and above for the course and install 'create-react-native-app' 
* we install it with `sudo npm install -g create-react-native-app`
* we go to our workspace and run `create-react-native-app my-first-app`
* it installs expo-cli
* we cd in our app folder /my-first-app and run `npm start`
* WE NEED THE WATCHMAN FIX
```
echo 999999 | sudo tee -a /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches     && \
  echo 999999 | sudo tee -a /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events  && \
  echo 999999 | sudo tee -a /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances && \
  watchman shutdown-server 
```
* once app starts we download expo app on our mobile and scan the qr code with the app
* it launches on EXPO and a web server at 19002 is used for development
* expo is good for developing and testing aps but not good for publishing apps
* create-react-native-app (expo) runs a dev server as long as its running
* we open up app.js and mod <Text> content. it refreshes on device

### Lecture 6 - Dealing with Limitations of React Native

* React Native apps are hard to work.
* They allow us to write native apps with out knowing swift or java code
* Ionic provides ready made prestyled components that are platform dependent
* React Native does NOT do that. it gives a DOM like canvas and we have to style all manually
* In RN we get only basic set of prebuilt components
* RN has plenty of 3rd party libs
* So RN is not as easy as IONIC but is offers better perfor4mance (native)
* Problems with RN and how to solve them:
	* No or very Little Cross-Platform Styling of Components: => Style COmponents on our own or use 3rd party libs
	* Only a Basic Set of Pre-Built Components: => Build Components on our own or use Third-Party-Libraries
	* Tools to Create Responsive Design but no Responsiveness Out-of-the-Box: => Create REsponsive Designs on our own (check for Device-Size and OS)
* React Native gets a new Version each month
* Breaking Chaneges do happen
* High dependency on 3rd party libs that also change
* Bugs (evolving but used in production)
* Alternatives to RN:
	* Build Real Native APps. Downside? (Learn Java/Android for Android and Swift/ObjectiveC for iOS)
	* Build a Progressive Web App (Webapps using Native Feats). Downside? Users might not use a browser/OS supporting it
	* Use Ionic or similar cordova based solition (Native App running a webpage) Downside? Worst performance because of Webview
* There are TOols to overcome RN challenges

### Lecture 7 - What a Good React Native Course Offers

* introduction to Core Concepts
* teach the Basics
* dive into common 3rd party libs
* explain how to use important Tools
* show practical Examples
* focus on allowing us to move on on our own (how to find the solution)

### Lecture 8 - Course Requirements
